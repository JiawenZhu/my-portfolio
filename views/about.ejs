    My name is Jiawen Zhu, a graduate of San Francisco State University with a GPA of 3.45. I can work full time since I have finished my schooling.<br/><br/>
    
    Although I am a very humble person, I will list my accomplishments.  In my Computer Science class, I led my team in creating a fully functional website. I was the front-end tech lead and enjoyed talking to my teammates anywhere. We used Slack as our communication tool, while we were not able to meet. No matter how much of a struggle we had at the time,  We have always followed industry procedures. By continuously working hard, we were able to deliver a fully functional and well-tested web application. Besides the coursework, I also built a chat application for my side project, because I was very interested in learning chat applications. It was a communication tool which allows users to send texts and files to each other through provided IP address.<br/><br/>
    
     For my professional life, I worked with a PHD professor to help the students to improve their knowledge in a software development class. In the end, the students, successfully, were able to build many interesting applications with java including Parser, Compiler, and a game we designed in Java OOP.  I was very happy to help many students with different skills sets which also brought the joy of working with different people; with different backgrounds and knowledge.   I think I will be a great fit for the company since I have worked with people from all over the world. It’s been fascinating. this past year, I have worked with people from Vietnam, Russian, Korean and China. Finally, I’m looking forward to contributing my knowledge and energy to meet our company goals.<br/>
